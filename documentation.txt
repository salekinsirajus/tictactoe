Description:
The game Tic-Tac_Toe is a very common
game played around the world. The simplest form of the
game consists of a 3x3 square box, with two possible elements:
X and O.

Typically two players play the game, and each has to choose one
symbol at the beginning of the game. Each has a chance to put
his/her element in the squares and whoever can make a set of three
elements horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins the game.

Structure of the game:
We are going to develop the game in two stages.
First: we'll develop the game for two human players. This will
require two element objects and a 3x3 square box object. A third
driver program will control the interaction between the objects.

Second: We'll develop an intelligent agent that can play as a human.
We're basically eliminating the need of another human to play.
